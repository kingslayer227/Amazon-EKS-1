# Amazon-EKS-1

Using AWS EKS Service and Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster in AWS.
It requires Multi-node Cluster.
In which Master node is fully managed by AWS (for which they actually charge you) and we need to provide details of Slave nodes.
Then will deploy MYSQL and WORDPRESS on that cluster with deploying Prometheus and Grafana on it for Monitoring purpose.
